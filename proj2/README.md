# 🍽️ A Quick Start Guide to BiteCode

**BiteCode** brings together food delivery and competitive programming in a unique, gamified experience. 

It allows users and competitive programmers to **order food and earn rewards** — getting **discounts on every order** through quick problem-solving challenges.  

After placing an order, the clock starts ticking ⏱️ — **solve a coding question before your delivery partner arrives** to earn **up to 20% off** your order!  

It’s where every byte earns you a bite!

---

## 🚀 Overview

BiteCode has been developed as part of CSC510 - Software Engineering project at NC State University to demonstrate the design and implementation of an interactive, dual-purpose web platform.

It combines two main components:

1. **Food Delivery Application**  
   A full-stack web app built using **MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN)**.  
   It enables users to discover restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and participate in timed coding challenges that unlock instant rewards.

2. **Judge0 Frontend**  
   A React-based interface powered by the open-source **Judge0 API**, used to compile and execute code in real time.  
   This module handles the challenge portion — validating code submissions and dynamically calculating rewards or discounts based on user performance.

The repository also includes an **Archived** directory that stores earlier prototypes, development scripts, and reference materials used during the design phase.

## 👥 Intended Users

- **Foodies & Customers** – who want to enjoy meals while participating in quick coding challenges to earn discounts.  
- **Competitive Programmers** – who love solving problems under real-world time pressure (literally racing the delivery timer).  
- **Developers & Students** – interested in exploring full-stack application design and API integration.  
- **Educators** – who want to adapt the concept into interactive classroom experiences combining logic and engagement.

## 🌟 Why Choose Our Project?

Our project — **BiteCode** — blends **Food Delivery**, **Gamified Coding Challenges**, and an **Interactive Judge0 Frontend** into one cohesive full-stack system.  
It’s not just a project to run — it’s a project you can *grow*, *extend*, and *learn from*.

### 🚀 Why It’s Worth Contributing
- **Modern Tech Stack:**  
  Built with **MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Bootstrap, and Jest**, it offers hands-on experience across the entire MERN stack — plus real API integration with **Judge0**, making it ideal for full-stack and DevOps learners alike.

- **Strong Foundation, Easy to Extend:**  
  The modular backend and decoupled frontend make adding new ideas seamless — you can go beyond food delivery.  
  💡 *Example:* Replace coding challenges with your **chess engine** — users could solve chess puzzles to earn discounts and rewards, leveraging the same “challenge” architecture!

- **Comprehensive Testing (161 Tests!):**  
  The system is battle-tested with **161 Jest + Pytest testcases**, covering:
  - Customer, restaurant, driver, and payment workflows  
  - Coupon and challenge APIs  
  - Frontend UI interactions and API integration  
  - Judge0 backend execution scenarios across multiple languages  
  - Core edge cases: authentication guards, invalid inputs, runtime/compile errors  
  This extensive coverage ensures stability and a reliable foundation for future enhancements.

### 🧠 Ideas for Future Contributors
1. **Adaptive Challenge Difficulty:**  
   Dynamically adjust coding (or chess) challenge difficulty based on a user’s **order frequency, accuracy, or past performance**.

2. **Chess Engine Integration:**  
   Hook up your **own chess engine** — share your toughest positions and let users solve puzzles to **earn discounts** on their orders.

3. **Driver Geolocation Tracking:**  
   Integrate **Google Maps APIs** to enable live **driver location tracking**, route visualization, and estimated delivery times.

4. **UI/UX & Stability Enhancements:**  
   Improve responsiveness, add dark mode, refine transitions, and enhance dashboard consistency for customers, restaurants, and drivers.

5. **Payment & Security Upgrades:**  
   Add features like **payment verification**, **refund management**, secure transaction logs, and **audit trails** for real-world robustness.

6. **Analytics & Gamification:**  
   Create dashboards for tracking performance, average delivery time, and challenge completion rates; reward consistent solvers or fast deliveries.

### 📈 Code Quality & Coverage
- **Extensive Testing:** 161 unit, integration, and end-to-end testcases across Python and JavaScript.  
- **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions CI pipelines automatically run backend + frontend test suites on every commit.  
- **Structured Documentation:** Each module (models, routes, public JS, and frontend tests) has detailed `.md` documentation to ease onboarding.  
- **Clear Contribution Path:** Well-defined `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files guide newcomers through setup and best practices.
